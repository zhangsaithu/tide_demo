# Translation Initiation site DEtector (TIDE)
This is a demo to predict translation initiation sites using TIDE.

Guidance:

1. Install scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/) and keras (https://keras.io/) first.

2. Edit file paths (e.g., homepath) in the scripts based on your settings.

3. Put the test data in the data/ folder if you want to predict your own data. Otherwise, directly run codes/tide_test.py for our test data.

4. Enjoy yourself!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me :)
